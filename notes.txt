each message needs to be encrypted with a unique IV
each message needs to identify the key it uses

# message format

opcode(1) = MESSAGE
keyId = hkdf(peerId, key, 'keyid', 16) -- where peerId is the peer that set this key
seqno(2) = a counter maintained by the sender
senderId = public key of sender
encrypted[2] { -- i.e., a buffer with a length encoded on 2 bytes
  message
  signature over message
}

The nonce for this message is derived from the senderId:
nonce = hkdf(seqno(2), senderId, 'nonce', 12)

opcode(1) = REKEY
senderId = public key of sender
repeated[2] { -- i.e., repeated with a count that is encoded on a length of 2
  peerId = public key of peer
  encipheredKey(16) = key XOR hkdf(0, DH(sender, peer), 'key', 16)
}

Note: one consequence of this scheme is that it's not possible to reshare the
same key - any attempt to reshare a key will result in a new identifier for that
key.  That makes old messages inaccessible to new agents.  That's a desirable
characteristic on the whole.
